#Algo Compare

###A simple python program for comparing the performance of algorithms


__steps to use:__

1. define functions for the algorithms to be tested

NOTE: be sure the functions take a list of integers as an argument,
or modify the code as necessary

2. modify the wrapper function calls to the new algo function and their args

3. alter the file name and destination for the plots file

NOTE the code will need to be extended to generate more plots for comparison
